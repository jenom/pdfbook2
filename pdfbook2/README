DESCRIPTION

    Create print-ready PDF files from some INPUT PDF files for booklet printing.
    The resulting files need to be printed in landscape/long edge double sided
    printing. The default paper format depends on the locale and is choosen by
    pdfjam. It can be set with the --paper option. 
    
    Before the pdf is composed the INPUT file is cropped to the relevant area in
    order to discard unnecessary white spaces. In this process, all pages are
    cropped to the same dimensions. Extra margins can be defined at the edges of 
    the booklet and in the middle where the binding occurs.
    
    The OUTPUT is written to INPUT-book.pdf. Existing files will be overwritten.
    All input files are processed seperatly.

EXAMPLES

    To simply create a booklet from input.pdf you can use
        
        pdfbook2 input.pdf
        
    to create input-book.pdf. To select a special type of paper you can do
        
        pdfbook2 --paper=letter input.pdf
    
    for letter or
        
        pdfbook2 --paper=a4paper input.pdf
        
    for standard A4. To increase the inner margin for binding use
    
        pdfbook2 --inner-margin=200 input.pdf
        
    to increase the default value of 150. You can submit multiple files to the 
    script for processing like
        
        pdfbook2 input1.pdf input2.pdf
        
    which will result in input1-book.pdf and input2-book.pdf.
